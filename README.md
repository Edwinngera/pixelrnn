# PixelRNN in the TensorFlow

This is simple implementation of RNN in tensorflow used for image classification task.

## Dataset

Dataset used in this project is MNIST dataset. You can download it by using built-in TensorFlow functions. For more explanation open the .ipynb file.

## Install

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supported Python version
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Python version used in this project: 3.5+

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Libraries used

> *  [TensorFlow](http://tensorflow.org) 1.2.0
> *  [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org) 1.10.4
> *  [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) 2.0.2
> *  [tqdm](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tqdm) 4.15.0

## Code

The whole code is inside **pixel_rnn.ipynb**. I haven't moved helper functions to a different file beucase of the testing purpose.


## Run

To run this project you will need some software, like Anaconda, which provides support for running .ipynb files (Jupyter Notebook).

After making sure you have that, you can run from a terminal or cmd next lines:

`ipython notebook pixel_rnn.ipynb`
